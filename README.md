## grapheme_replacer
This is a tiny little Python program to help translate English sentences into a fantasy language for games, etc.
Vowel and consonant graphemes are grouped by phoneme.
A simple search and replace is performed on the input text.

My example code translates the following text like so:

Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. = Evuuawnu hauzz thu rut taw frudawm awf thauut, gawnzzgungu aund rukugawn; thu rut ungkawzz frudawm taw gaung hu rukugawn auu bukuf, aund frudawm, uuthu aukawnu auu un gawmmunutu wuth awthuzz aund un pubkug auu pruvautu, taw maunuzz hu rukugawn auu bukuf un tuugung, praugtu, wauuzzhup aund awbzzuvaungu.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog = Thu gawg brawwn fawg jumzz awvu thu kauzu dawg
